RSwitch wasn't my idea. It's been around forever on the [R for macOS Developer's Page](http://mac.r-project.org/) but stopped working on Catalina since it hadn't been updated in ages, was only 32-bit (which is a no-go for Catalina), and had no available source code to modify.

Despite having found and old-old copy of the source code by hacking URLs via the Internet Archive, none of that code was used to make this incarnation of RSwitch.

RSwitch uses three external frameworks to accomplish its tasks:

- [SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup) by Nabil Chatbi
- [ProcInfo](https://github.com/objective-see/ProcInfo) by the infamous Patrick Wardle
- [VersionCompare](https://github.com/DragonCherry/VersionCompare/) by DragonCherry

The current (but, likely not final) app icon and menubar icon is based on the ['dial' Noun Project font icon](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=dial&i=866019#) created by Icon Mark.
